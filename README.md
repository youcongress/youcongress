# YouCongress

Welcome to YouCongress!

YouCongress is a non-profit and open-source platform that helps policymakers, journalists, companies, and citizens see what people actually want on AI-safety questions. You can vote directly or choose trusted voices to vote on your behalf, and every poll is enriched with verifiable, sourced quotes so positions are clear and accountable.

We're still shaping YouCongress, but you already can:
- create a liquid-democracy poll
- vote directly or delegate to trusted experts and public figures. When you don't vote, you'll follow the majority of your chosen delegates—unless you cast a direct vote.
- add arguments
- add sourced quotes from researchers, officials, and public figures
- add comments
