# YouCongress

Welcome to YouCongress!

YouCongress is a non-profit and open-source platform that helps policymakers, journalists, companies, and citizens see what people actually want on AI-safety questions. You can vote directly or choose trusted voices to vote on your behalf, and every poll is enriched with verifiable, sourced quotes so positions are clear and accountable.

# Why This Matters
Forecasters ask "What will happen?" We ask "What should we do?" or "What would we love to happen even when unlikely?" Inspired by Scott Alexander's "Moloch" — the idea that misaligned incentives can push everyone toward outcomes nobody wants — YouCongress makes shared preferences visible and legible. By pairing direct voting, optional delegation, and sourced expertise, we offer a practical coordination tool: not binding referendums, but decision support that helps leaders choose policies aligned with public and expert values. Starting with AI safety.

We're still shaping YouCongress, but you already can:
- create a liquid-democracy poll
- vote directly or delegate to trusted experts and public figures. When you don't vote, you'll follow the majority of your chosen delegates—unless you cast a direct vote.
- add arguments
- add sourced quotes from researchers, officials, and public figures
- add comments
