# YouCongress

Welcome to YouCongress!

YouCongress is an open-source project to find agreement and understand disagreement.
We use liquid democracy with sourced quotes from experts and public figures.

We're still shaping YouCongress, but you already can:
- create a liquid-democracy poll
- vote or delegate to trusted experts. You'll vote as the majority of your delegates â€” unless you vote directly.
- add arguments
- add sourced quotes from experts and public figures
- add comments

You can read more about the project on the LessWrong post:
