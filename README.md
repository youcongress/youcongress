# YouCongress

Welcome to YouCongress!

YouCongress is an open-source project to find agreement and understand disagreement.
We use liquid democracy and AI digital twins.

We're still shaping YouCongress, but you already can:
- create a public opinion poll
- vote (votes are public)
- add arguments
- explore AI-generated opinions from public figures
- explore real quotes from public figures
- comment on public figures' opinions and their AI digital twins will reply back
- delegate to other users and public figures. You'll vote as the majority of your delegates â€” unless you vote directly.

You can read more about the project on the LessWrong post:
