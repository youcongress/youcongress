  <p class="pt-6"><b>Content</b></p>
  <p>
    Our Service allows you to create votings, vote, delegate, add opinions and share text and other media. All these are public and may be accessed by any other users.
  </p>
  <p>
    We reserve the right to remove any content that we deem inappropriate without prior notice.
  </p>
  <p>
    For example, we aim not to have not too similar votings. So we will archive or delete any duplications. Thank you for your understanding.

    Our Service may contain links to third party web sites or services that are not owned or controlled by YouCongress.
