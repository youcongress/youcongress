            Forecasters ask "What will happen?" We ask "What should we do?" or "What would we love to happen even when unlikely?" Inspired by Scott Alexander's "Moloch" — the idea that misaligned incentives can push everyone toward outcomes nobody wants — YouCongress makes shared preferences visible and legible. By pairing direct voting, optional delegation, and sourced expertise, we offer a practical coordination tool: not binding referendums, but decision support that helps leaders choose policies aligned with public and expert values. Starting with AI safety.

            YouCongress users can choose a list of delegates, similar to following others on social media.
            However, here, users' votes align with the majority of their delegates unless they vote personally.
            For example, if a user has five delegates who have voted on an issue, and three of them vote in favor while two vote against, the user's vote will automatically be in favor too. This holds unless the user votes directly, in which case the delegates' votes don't matter.
