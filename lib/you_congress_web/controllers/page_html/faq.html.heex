                delegate to other users and public figures. You'll vote as the majority of your delegates â€” unless you vote directly.

            YouCongress users can choose a list of delegates, similar to following others on social media.
            However, here, users' votes align with the majority of their delegates unless they vote personally.
            For example, if a user has five delegates who hpt-4ave voted on an issue, and three of them vote in favor while two vote against, the user's vote will automatically be in favor too. This holds unless the user votes directly, in which case the delegates' votes don't matter.
          </p>
          <p class="text-base leading-7 text-gray-600 ">
            Future enhancements will introduce additional delegation models, including topic-specific delegation. This will enable users to appoint delegates for votes concerning specific areas such as their local community, economic matters, AI-related issues, and more.
          </p>
          <p class="text-base leading-7 text-gray-600 pt-4">
            Yet, users will be able to filter the results by direct votes, delegated votes, human votes, and AI-generated votes. This way, if one is only interested in human direct votes, the platform will remain useful.

            AI-generated content is already faithful on topics where the opinion of public figures is widely common.
            For example, the AI-generated perspective of Greta Thunberg or Bill Gates on climate change is reasonable.
            Also, not only will this continue improving, but at some point we'll be able to return real quotes with a source so anyone can confirm the public figure said that.

          <p class="text-base leading-7 text-gray-600 pt-4">
            Yet, AI-generated perspectives can't be trusted yet. But they do serve as a starting point. Then, participants have the ability to add real quotes from notable figures if they provide a source with an URL (so anyone can verify that quote).
